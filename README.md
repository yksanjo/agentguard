# AgentGuard

> Unified AI Agent Security & Governance Platform

## What This Is

AgentGuard is an open-source platform that helps organizations monitor, secure, and govern their AI agents. Think of it as a security dashboard for all your autonomous AI systems - giving you visibility into what they're doing, when they're doing it, and whether it's safe.

## The Current Landscape

Right now, we're seeing a massive shift. Companies are deploying AI agents everywhere - handling customer service, processing payments, making trading decisions, automating operations. These AI systems can act on their own, making decisions without a human checking every step.

Here's the problem: traditional security tools were built for human users and static systems. They don't understand AI agent behavior. When an AI agent starts acting weird, or gets compromised, or makes a mistake at scale, we need new tools to detect and respond.

The industry is moving fast, but the safety infrastructure is still catching up. Regulatory bodies are starting to ask questions about AI governance, but there aren't clear frameworks yet. We built AgentGuard to help fill that gap.

## Why We Built This

We're open-sourcing AgentGuard because we believe security should be collaborative. When it comes to AI agents in financial systems, we're all learning together. By making this public:

- **More people can contribute** - Security gets better when it's a community effort
- **Smaller organizations can benefit** - Not everyone has massive security budgets
- **We learn faster** - Sharing knowledge helps the whole industry improve
- **Transparency builds trust** - Financial systems need to be trustworthy, and that starts with open tools

This isn't about selling software - it's about making financial AI systems safer for everyone.

## What AgentGuard Does

AgentGuard gives you a unified view of all your AI agents. It automatically discovers agents across your infrastructure, monitors their behavior in real-time, and alerts you when something looks off. It can enforce security policies, respond to incidents automatically, and generate compliance reports.

Think of it like this: if you have 100 AI agents doing different things, AgentGuard is your command center. It tells you which agents are healthy, which ones are risky, and what they're all doing right now.

## Who This Is For

This is for anyone working with AI agents in production:
- **Developers** building AI-powered features who want to keep them secure
- **Security teams** trying to understand new AI-related risks
- **Compliance teams** preparing for regulatory questions about AI governance
- **Risk managers** evaluating AI deployments
- **Anyone curious** about how to make AI systems safer

## Current Status

This is an open-source project in active development. We're building this in public because we believe the industry needs better tools for AI agent security, and we want to collaborate with the community.
